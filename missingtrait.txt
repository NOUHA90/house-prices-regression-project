How I deal with missing values?
	- if the interval of missing values in a column represents 80% or more 
	compared to the shape of our dataset,
	I consider it useless most of the time
	- if, less than 80%, there are several other techniques which are generally based on the imputation strategy:
		- either we replace by the most frequent value
		- either by the median if our variable follows the normal distribution
		- either we use machine learning algorithms:
			as:
				* SimpleImputer
				* regression if there are correlation and linearity relationships between the variables
				* classification: KNN
